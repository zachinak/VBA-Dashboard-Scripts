The Homelessness dashboards were originally built on an excel file with thousands of formulas, a separate formula for each data point. This proved to be a poor use of excel formulas due to the inability to scale the solution as the spreadsheet became unworkable when trying to run that many different formulas. So we needed a new means to pull all the necessary data points in a more efficient matter. I wrote up these scripts using VBA to streamline the process which allowed us to easily update the data as needed without locking up a computer for 10 minutes every time the excel file needed to be saved!
